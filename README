Neo4j GEOFF Plugin
===================

Who's GEOFF?
-------------
Go here: http://py2neo.org/geoff 

OK, so what do I do with it?
-----------------------------
Simply compile the code at gas mark 6 for 20 minutes and serve in the
plugins directory with a server restart to garnish.

And then what?
---------------
Via the REST interface, pass GEOFF source code through a POST request, e.g.:

post /db/data/ext/GEOFFPlugin/graphdb/load {"source": "(Alice)\n(Bob)\n(Alice)-[:KNOWS]->(Bob)"}
